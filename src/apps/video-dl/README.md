## Setup

## Start App
`yarn run start`

## Notes
- Parcel is on beta version. Consider upgrading when it is not longer beta.
- Parcel's public url doesn't work. Have to configure in package.json target.
- This is a problem because we can't do proxies correctly.
- For now, we will rely on subdomains.
